Question #3: Describe a recent interaction with someone who was non-technical. What did you need to communicate and how did you do it?


   As the Pipeline Technical Director, I had a conversation with the real-time department coordinator about a project I recently 
completed: the "Unreal Depot." This system was designed to store our Unreal assets, created in-house or  those downloaded from the Epic 
Marketplace.
   During our discussion, I explained to the coordinator how the Unreal Depot would enhance our workflow by providing a centralized 
repository for our assets. I emphasized the importance of their role in adding our existing assets to the depot and reporting any bugs or 
suggesting improvements from a user perspective.
   Recognizing the coordinator's expertise in the real-time department, I expressed my appreciation for their assistance and their unique 
insight into how the system would be utilized. I assured them that their feedback would be invaluable in refining the Unreal Depot to meet 
the specific needs of our team.
   Understanding their responsibilities, the coordinator expressed their readiness to contribute and requested guidance on the process of 
adding assets and reporting any issues they encountered. I acknowledged their enthusiasm and commitment, assuring them that I would 
provide a detailed guide to assist them. I encouraged open communication, urging them to reach out if they faced any challenges or had 
questions along the way.
   Throughout our interaction, I maintained a collaborative and supportive tone, emphasizing the coordinator's integral role in adding 
assets and improving the user experience of the Unreal Depot specifically for the real-time department.
